Ansible:-
Ansible is a configuration management, deployment and orchestration(control) tool, it aims to provide large productivity gains to wide variety of automation chalanges. which works on push notification.

it mitigates of manual tasks and execution time while chances of errors are very less.

uses yaml language which is easy to understand, write and execute.


three types of ways to execute ansible

1)ad-hoc
2)modules
3)playbook

1)ad-hoc
ad-hoc commands are basic linux commands which can be run individually to perform quick function, there is no idempotency.

these are for one time usage so are not used for configuration management and deployment

2)modules:-
it checks either command is affecting already exist object or not, it has idempotency.
-m flag define this is module

3)playbook:-
One or more modules combined makes it playbook in ansible. Yaml format is used to write playbook.

it consist of var, task, handlers, files, templetes and roles.


it is divided into many sections

Target section:-
defines the host against which playbooks task has to be executed.

variable section:-
defines variables.

task section:-
list of all modules that we need to run in an order.


Handlers:-

Handlers are just like regular tasks in ansible that only run when notified. Handlers are a very useful as well as important concept in Ansible.

handlers are like task but run when called by another task.

Notify directive:- just notify (its your turn go get em)
Handler directive:- groups tasks under it self.

if we change in ssh config then sshd needs a restart which we cant do untill all done after which we can send a signal to a task that will restart the sshd service.


Dry run:-
check whether playbook is formatted correctly

ansible-playbook handlers.yml --check


Loops:=-

to repeat a task multiple times.
